## Note About Legacy Items
Every file in the legacy folder comes from my attempts to train and use the LLama-3.1-8B model.
None of these files are used in the final iteration of the project.
They soley exist as a proof of work.
Some of these files could not be uploaded to the repository due to privacy reasons.
The model and the weights also could not be uploaded due to the large size of the files.
