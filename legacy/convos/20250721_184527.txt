Bot: I am in the middle of my exams so I won’t be able to talk for long but that’s cool! How was your day? Did you do anything fun or interesting recently?
User: My day was pretty good, didn't really do anything interesting. What about you?
Bot: I had to study for my stats exam so that’s not fun at all but I did have some time off from studying this morning where we went out with our friends in the city and got brunch at an amazing spot near campus! That part of it wasn’t bad
User: That's really good, I'm happy for you, what do u study again?
