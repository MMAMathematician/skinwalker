[7/7/2025, 7:38:55 PM] Britanny: Yeah but it's also about 30 minutes so it's not worth it
[7/7/2025, 7:39:24 PM] Anthony: 30 minutes is a lot quicker than 50 💀

[8/7/2025, 10:17:36 PM] Britanny: 加油
[8/7/2025, 10:17:45 PM] Anthony: Thank uouuuu, you got this too
[8/7/2025, 10:17:55 PM] Anthony: Lemme google trandkate that real quick
[8/7/2025, 10:18:25 PM] Britanny: hahaha
[8/7/2025, 10:18:29 PM] Anthony: It says come on, is that accurate?
[8/7/2025, 10:19:59 PM] Britanny: Sure! Here's an explanation in English:

The Chinese phrase "加油" (jiā yóu) doesn't have one exact equivalent in English — it can mean different things depending on the context. Here are the main meanings and how you'd say them in English:


---

1. To encourage someone (like saying "You can do it!")

When you want to cheer someone on, like before an exam, during a competition, or at work, you can say:

"You can do it!"

"Come on!"

"Go for it!"

"Keep it up!"

"Hang in there!"


These expressions are similar in spirit to "加油" — they’re supportive and motivating.


---

2. To cheer for someone (like at a sports event or performance)

If you're showing support or enthusiasm for someone publicly, like shouting from the sidelines, you can say:

"Let’s go, [name]!"
(e.g. “Let’s go, Lisa!”)

"Go, go, go!"

"You’ve got this!"

"Way to go!"


These are often used to cheer on athletes, friends, or performers.


---

3. To get gasoline for a vehicle

If you're talking about literally putting fuel in a car, "加油" is:

"Refuel"

"Get gas" (more common in American English)

"Fill up the tank"


Example:

> “I need to get some gas before we hit the road.”
“Let’s fill up at the next gas station.”




---

So in summary:
"加油" can mean encourage someone, cheer someone on, or put gas in a car, depending on the situation.

Let me know if you want to practice using it in a sentence!
[8/7/2025, 10:20:48 PM] Britanny: Before I thought come on it was like saying somebody did something bad then the other person would say come on bro
[8/7/2025, 10:21:05 PM] Anthony: HAHAHAHAJA
[8/7/2025, 10:21:23 PM] Anthony: Ok expression of encouragement, that’s what I figured
[8/7/2025, 10:21:38 PM] Britanny: Yes 🙂‍↕️
[8/7/2025, 10:21:54 PM] Anthony: Actually that’s a lie, I thought it was slightly negative HAHAHA
[8/7/2025, 10:22:27 PM] Anthony: I hope life treats you well tho, your shifts sound roughhhhh
[8/7/2025, 10:23:28 PM] Britanny: hahaha
[8/7/2025, 10:23:47 PM] Britanny: Yeah if life doesn't treat me well, I'm going to change the life
[8/7/2025, 10:24:44 PM] Britanny: Okay okay you should work on your study
[8/7/2025, 10:25:36 PM] Anthony: I hope u can change ur life for the better 🫡
[8/7/2025, 10:25:58 PM] Anthony: I have a week break so thank god, but I need to use it to catch up
[8/7/2025, 10:27:40 PM] Britanny: Hahaha hopefully
[8/7/2025, 10:27:48 PM] Britanny: Sounds good! 👍
[8/7/2025, 10:29:00 PM] Anthony: Goodnight:)
[8/7/2025, 10:29:14 PM] Britanny: Wow! You always sleep so early
[8/7/2025, 10:29:22 PM] Britanny: Good night little piggy
[8/7/2025, 10:30:25 PM] Anthony: PIGGY???
[8/7/2025, 10:30:30 PM] Anthony: 😭 😭 😭
[8/7/2025, 10:30:42 PM] Britanny: Piggy is cute
[8/7/2025, 10:31:01 PM] Anthony: Ok 👀
[8/7/2025, 10:31:15 PM] Anthony: Usually when u call someone a pig, ur calling them ugly 😭
[8/7/2025, 10:31:23 PM] Britanny: No
[8/7/2025, 10:32:01 PM] Anthony: Alright if you say so 👀
[8/7/2025, 10:32:05 PM] Britanny: In Chinese, calling someone "小猪猪" (xiǎo zhū zhū) literally means "little piggy." However, the meaning depends heavily on context and tone.

Common Interpretations in English:

1. A cute nickname – It’s often used affectionately, like calling someone "cutie" or "snugglebug." The repetition of "猪" makes it sound more playful and endearing.

Example: A girlfriend might call her boyfriend "小猪猪" to tease him in a sweet way.



2. Teasing someone for being lazy or eating a lot – Just like in English, calling someone a "pig" can also mean they overeat, are messy, or lazy, but "小猪猪" softens that tone into a more lighthearted joke.

Example: "You finished the whole cake? 小猪猪~"



3. Self-deprecating – Someone might refer to themselves as "小猪猪" to be cute or funny, especially if they’re joking about being lazy or loving food.



Summary:

Calling someone 小猪猪 is usually affectionate and playful, not insulting. It’s like saying “my little piggy” in a sweet or teasing way, depending on the relationship and context.

[9/7/2025, 9:40:14 PM] Britanny: In future, Once you print the EoD report for a till, make sure nobody puts through any transactions on that till until you’ve completed it. 
If you have to leave to check anything, don’t forget to let till staff know that you’ll be back shortly and ask them not to use that till until you return and complete the till off for that till. Leave a note on the keyboard/monitor accordingly.
[9/7/2025, 9:40:28 PM] Britanny: Sounds good

[9/7/2025, 9:54:04 PM] Anthony: Is western education considered legendary?
[9/7/2025, 9:55:14 PM] Britanny: Yeah, on talk shows. It's always saying Western education is teaching people to be proud of themselves, but in Asian culture it's like make people become really self-conscious
[9/7/2025, 9:56:15 PM] Anthony: I think that’s more of a cultural thing than an education thing
[9/7/2025, 9:56:39 PM] Britanny: The culture is a form of education
[9/7/2025, 9:56:49 PM] Britanny: People being educated in this type of environment
[9/7/2025, 9:57:29 PM] Anthony: Fair I can see that
[9/7/2025, 9:57:41 PM] Anthony: How are u finding the culture here so far?
[9/7/2025, 9:58:09 PM] Britanny: I feel like it's really decent.
[9/7/2025, 9:59:10 PM] Britanny: I can fill a bit of distance between people to be honest when people are communicating but this a type of warmness behind it like people behaving really nicely
[9/7/2025, 9:59:28 PM] Britanny: But it feels like people performing really nicely
[9/7/2025, 9:59:34 PM] Britanny: I don't know how to describe this
[9/7/2025, 9:59:52 PM] Britanny: Do you want to have a voice call?

[12/7/2025, 9:58:18 PM] Anthony: I’m waiting for a friend of mine to finish work, we’re gonna get some burgers from a place that’s only open at night

[12/7/2025, 10:08:06 PM] Anthony: Did I say something wrong?
[12/7/2025, 10:08:19 PM] Britanny: Nothing wrong
[12/7/2025, 10:08:23 PM] Britanny: Why
[12/7/2025, 10:09:11 PM] Anthony: Just checking, just thought ur reply’s sounded a little off
[12/7/2025, 10:09:14 PM] Anthony: It’s ok
[12/7/2025, 10:09:57 PM] Britanny: Nothing. It's just you said your friend work on Saturday. Then I started to think before. I thought the boss would give me the shift on Saturday but she didn't
[12/7/2025, 10:10:04 PM] Britanny: I guess I will work on Monday and Friday
[12/7/2025, 10:10:30 PM] Anthony: Ahhhh I see I see
[12/7/2025, 10:10:35 PM] Britanny: Even though I know that's the new work is difficult to get the shift on Saturday and Sunday, but I thought because I work my way through volunteer and get familiar with the pharmacy, I thought she would give me the position
[12/7/2025, 10:10:39 PM] Anthony: yeah he works pretty much every weekend
[12/7/2025, 10:10:55 PM] Anthony: I hope she eventually does
[12/7/2025, 10:11:16 PM] Anthony: Does she know u did volunteer work?
[12/7/2025, 10:12:01 PM] Britanny: Of course she did
[12/7/2025, 10:12:20 PM] Britanny: I told her I'm going to do Saturday and Sunday volunteer job
[12/7/2025, 10:13:14 PM] Anthony: How long have u done the volunteering for?
[12/7/2025, 10:13:50 PM] Britanny: I think ever since I started this job
[12/7/2025, 10:13:56 PM] Britanny: Every week I would do volunteer jobs
[12/7/2025, 10:14:31 PM] Anthony: Are there any patterns you notice with the ones who get the weekend shifts?
[12/7/2025, 10:18:18 PM] Britanny: Because they work there longer than me
[12/7/2025, 10:23:08 PM] Anthony: Ahhh ok it’s just experience
[12/7/2025, 10:23:16 PM] Anthony: You may just have to wait :(
[12/7/2025, 10:24:54 PM] Britanny: Yeah, I will
