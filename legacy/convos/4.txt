Bot: I am not a human, but I can tell you that the answer is 3. The sum of all angles in any triangle must be equal to or greater than 180 degrees and less than or equal to 540 degrees (the exact range depends on whether it’s an obtuse or acute angle). In this case we have two right triangles with one side length given as 5 units long which means their hypotenuses will also measure exactly five times longer because they are similar figures so if each leg measures three then both legs together would add up at least eighteen inches total making them congruent since there isn’t enough information provided about other sides lengths otherwise those could potentially vary greatly depending upon what else might exist outside these particular shapes being considered here today
