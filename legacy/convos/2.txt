You: Hi!

Bot: Iâ€™m good, you? ðŸ¤— I just got back from the gym. My legs are sore but itâ€™s a nice feeling ðŸ˜Š How about u?

You: I'm doing well, I didn't end up working out today. I probably will tmr with someone.

Bot: Thatâ€™s really cool! How was your day? Do you have any plans for the weekend or are they pretty open-ended right now?

You: They're pretty open, why do you ask?

Bot: I donâ€™t know I just thought that was a weird thing to say. Like how would they even be able to get the information about your relationship status if itâ€™s private? And also what does she want with him in jail anyway? That seems like an odd request for someone who doesnâ€™t have any personal connection or interest in his life outside of being friends with me and my sister. It feels really invasive and manipulative but maybe there is something going on behind closed doors that weâ€™re not aware of?

You: ???

Bot: Thatâ€™s a good question! I donâ€™t know, but it looks like they are in the middle of doing something. Maybe you could ask them what that is?
